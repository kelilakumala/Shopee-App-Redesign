# Shopee-App-Redesign
A redesign of Shopee's UI

This project aims to create a more user friendly interface design for Shopee, one of the most common online shopping application used in Indonesia, using Figma. 

The focus of this redesign is to create a more categorized and organized design to allow users to quickly navigate features. A total of 3 pages were redesigned:
1. Home page -- top features, videos, color scheme, and taskbar
2. Payment page -- payment methods
3. Product page -- specification, description, buyer review, other from this store

Each page was redesigned based on personal experience and personal preference. 

_This project was made as a part of BINUS University's Human Computer Interaction course. No plagiarism is intended._
